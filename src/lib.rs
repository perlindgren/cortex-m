//! Low level access to Cortex-M processors
//!
//! This crate provides:
//!
//! - Access to core peripherals like NVIC, SCB and SysTick.
//! - Access to core registers like CONTROL, MSP and PSR.
//! - Interrupt manipulation mechanisms
//! - Safe wrappers around Cortex-M specific instructions like `bkpt`
//!
//! # Optional features
//!
//! ## `inline-asm`
//!
//! When this feature is enabled the implementation of all the functions inside the `asm` and
//! `register` modules use inline assembly (`asm!`) instead of external assembly (FFI into separate
//! assembly files pre-compiled using `arm-none-eabi-gcc`). The advantages of enabling `inline-asm`
//! are:
//!
//! - Reduced overhead. FFI eliminates the possibility of inlining so all operations include a
//! function call overhead when `inline-asm` is not enabled.
//!
//! - Some of the `register` API only becomes available only when `inline-asm` is enabled. Check the
//! API docs for details.
//!
//! The disadvantage is that `inline-asm` requires a nightly toolchain.
//!
//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
//!
//! This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.31 and up. It *might*
//! compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

// This makes clippy warn about public functions which are not #[inline].
//
// Almost all functions in this crate result in trivial or even no assembly.
// These functions should be #[inline].
//
// If you do add a function that's not supposed to be #[inline], you can add
// #[allow(clippy::missing_inline_in_public_items)] in front of it to add an
// exception to clippy's rules.
//
// This should be done in case of:
//  - A function containing non-trivial logic (such as itm::write_all); or
//  - A generated #[derive(Debug)] function (in which case the attribute needs
//    to be applied to the struct).
